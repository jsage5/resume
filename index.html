      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Intrinsically motivated self-starter with a passion for
          helping others achieve their goals. Naturally an analytical
          thinker, my entrepreneurial experience has taught me it takes
          flexibility, and at times an unsystematic approach to identify
          key opportunities in dynamic environments. With an innate penchant
          for seeking discomfort, I am energized by obstacles, eager to be
          challenged, thrive under pressure and always learning something new.
